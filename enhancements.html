<h2>Enhancements</h2>
<p>The first enhancement that I completed on my web page was that of "Linear Gradient" going form top to bottom,
this feature allows for colours to fade in and out between colours and was applyed as a background colour, giving the 
page a stylish effect with a minimum feature. The code used was <strong>linear-gradient(to bottom, #4fc3f7 0%, #ffffff 100%)</strong></p>
<p>And my secend enhancement I belive is, the  border-radius feature used throughout the the entire web site by trying to 
incorporate it as best as to my abilities, this is a simple feature available in CSS but very strong when used appropriatly. 
Also it was not covered in the lecture slides, the code that was applyed was <strong>border-radius: 25px.</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion I beleive both of these features toghether give this web page an individual feel with a strong statment.</p>
