<h2>Our Products</h2>

experience with us is one of a life time. We have the only rail in Australia that 
been custom designed to take in the spectacular scenery that this vast country 
has to offer, as well as, uniquely built carriages so that an individual 
experience can be had.</p>
<p>Ticketing at the Great Dividing Rail is also a uniquely service, we offer two main 
categories of class Standard and First Class, in both categories we have three different
pricings, Adult, Seniors/Concession and Under 18, and a special family package
were a further 20% discount is applied on the total cost.</p>
<p>We also offer special pricing to how we calculate journeys, our journeys 
are labelled as TRIPS and you purchase the total number of single TRIPS you
will make. For e.g., if you wish to travel from Melbourne to Canberra that 
is only one single TRIP (meaning no stops in between), and if you intend to 
return to Melbourne you would purchase a TWO TRIPS ticket, giving you a 
25% discount on your second ticket. This discount also becomes greater 
the more tickets you buy, giving you greater value for money.
